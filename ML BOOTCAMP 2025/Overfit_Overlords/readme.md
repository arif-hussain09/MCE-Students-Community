## Project Explanation

This project is carried out as part of the **ML Bootcamp 2025** with the aim of gaining practical exposure to Machine Learning concepts and workflows.

The project focuses on solving a real-world problem using machine learning techniques. We begin by understanding the dataset and the problem statement, followed by cleaning and preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

After preprocessing, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is performed to identify important patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. This helps in selecting relevant features and improving model performance.

Next, different **machine learning models** are implemented and trained on the prepared dataset. The models are evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to compare their accuracy and reliability.

Based on evaluation results, the best-performing model is selected and optimized. The final model demonstrates how machine learning can be used to extract meaningful insights and make predictions from data.

This project helped us strengthen our understanding of the complete machine learning pipeline, teamwork, and practical problem-solving skills.
